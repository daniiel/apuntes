	Angular
	
	ng new first-app
	ng serve
	
	
	+ Components
	
	App-root is also something we see in the app.component.ts file
	in the selector, It looks like this is basically like our own HTML tag
	we're creating.
	
	La pagina que uno ve de localhost:4200, al cual el codigo pertenece,
	actualmente es el  index.html  file in the src folder. Here we also see
	'app-root' The scripts imports are missing because they are injected 
	dynamically.
	
	Angular carga la pagina. 
		
		<!doctype html>
		<html lang="en">
		<head>
		  <meta charset="utf-8">
		  <title>FirstApp</title>
		  <base href="/">
		  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
		  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
		</head>
		<body>
		  <app-root></app-root>
		</body>
		</html>
	
	Then we have these dinamically-injected script imports and these script imports will 
	dynamically replace  'app-root' with our own component.
	
	+ Install Bootstrap

	npm install --save bootstrap@3
	
	Note: 
		This installation is locally, not globaly, is just for the project that you are using
			
	- Add configuring Bootstrap (angular.json):
	
		"styles": [
			  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
			  "src/styles.css"
			]
	
	- app.module.ts : this is basically where we tell Angular which pieces belong to our
			app and there we have to add something to import another package from Angular.
			
			import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
			
			Typescript needs to know where things are, now with this import we can add it to 
			this imports array down 
			
			this is simply a feature understood by Angular since it's part of an Angular module
			
			@NgModule({
				..
				imports: [
					BrowserModule,
					FormsModule   ***
				]
			})

				
			Component decorator	
				
			@Component({
			  selector: 'app-sidebar',
			  templateUrl: './sidebar.component.html',
			  styleUrls: ['./sidebar.component.css']
			})
			
		- HTML inline 

		@Component({
		  selector: 'app-sidebar',
		  templateUrl: './sidebar.component.html',
		  styleUrls: ['./sidebar.component.css']
		})
		
		@Component({
		  selector: 'app-sidebar',
		  templateUrl: '<app-server></app-server>',
		  styleUrls: ['./sidebar.component.css']
		})
		
		- CSS inline
		
		@Component({
		  selector: 'app-root',
		  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
		  //styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
		  styles: [`
			h3 { color: red}
		  `]
		})
		
		- Convert the selector in a attribute
		
		@Component({
		  selector: 'app-sidebar',
		  templateUrl: './sidebar.component.html',
		  styleUrls: ['./sidebar.component.css']
		})
		
		<div class="container">
		  <div class="row">
			<div class="col-xs-12">
			  <h3>App Component!</h3>
			  <hr>
			  <app-sidebar></app-sidebar>
			</div>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		
		@Component({
		  selector: '[app-sidebar]',
		  templateUrl: './sidebar.component.html',
		  styleUrls: ['./sidebar.component.css']
		})
	
		<div class="container">
		  <div class="row">
			<div class="col-xs-12">
			  <h3>App Component!</h3>
			  <hr>
			  <div app-sidebar></div>
			</div>
		  </div>
		</div>
		
		@Component({
		  selector: '.app-sidebar',
		  templateUrl: './sidebar.component.html',
		  styleUrls: ['./sidebar.component.css']
		})
		
		<div class="container">
		  <div class="row">
			<div class="col-xs-12">
			  <h3>App Component!</h3>
			  <hr>
			  <!--<app-sidebar></app-sidebar>
			  <div app-sidebar></div>-->
			  <div class="app-sidebar"></div>
			</div>
		  </div>
		</div>
	
		
	- Databinding (enlace de datos)
	
	Une una fuente de datos entre el origen de datos y las vistas y se encarga de 
	sincronizarlos. Cada cambio en los datos se refleja automaticamente en los 
	elementos.
	
		- String Interpolation
			Allow us to display dynamic data on HTML page
		
			@Component({
			  selector: '.app-sidebar',
			  templateUrl: './sidebar.component.html',
			  styleUrls: ['./sidebar.component.css']
			})
			export class SidebarComponent {
			  serverId: number = 10;
			  serverStatus: string = 'offline';
			}
		
			<p>{{ 'server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is : {{ serverStatus}} </p>
	
	- Property binding

	Add attributes to tags that are binding with the .ts file
	
		<button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer">
		  Add Server
		</button>
		
		Property binding : <p [innerHTML]="allowNewServer"></p>
		String Interpolation: <p>{{allowNewServer}}</p>
		
	+ Directives
		. let server -> create a temporally variable
		*ngFor="let server of servers"
	
			
	+ Shared folder
		. Contain features or elements of our app which are shared across different features.

	+ Class "Entity"
	
		- ingredient.module.ts file
		
		export class Ingredient {
			public name: string;
			public amount: number;
			
			constructor(name: string, amount: number){
				this.name = name;
				this.amount = amount;
			}
		}
		
			. Simplify the attributes declaration, only add an accessor in front
			of the property name
			
		export class Ingredient {
			constructor(public name: string, public amount: number){
			}
		}
		
			it will automatically assign the values we receive in this constructor
			to these newly created properties.

	+ Interpolation binding

		<h1>{{title}}</h1>

	The double curly braces are Angular's interpolation binding syntax. 
	This interpolation binding presents the component's title property value inside the HTML header tag.
	
	+ Two-way binding
	
		<div>
		  <label>name:
			<input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name"/>
		  </label>
		</div>
		
	[(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.

	Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow in both directions: 
	from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name
	
		- The missing FormsModule
		
		Notice that the app stopped working when you added [(ngModel)]
		
		
	[(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.

	Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow in both directions: 
	from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name.
	
	AppModule
Angular needs to know how the pieces of your application fit together and what other files and libraries the app requires. This information is called metadata.

Some of the metadata is in the @Component decorators that you added to your component classes. Other critical metadata is in @NgModule decorators.

The most important @NgModule decorator annotates the top-level AppModule class.

+ NgModule

	@NgModule({
	  declarations: [
		AppComponent,
		HeroesComponent
	  ],
	  imports: [
		BrowserModule,
		FormsModule
	  ],
	  providers: [],
	  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
	})

	- Imports
	
	Then add FormsModule to the @NgModule metadata's imports array, which contains a list of external modules that the app needs.
	
	- @NgModule.declarations array.
	
	declares both application components, AppComponent and HeroesComponent.
	
	
	- *ngFor Directive
	
		<li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
	
	The *ngFor is Angular's repeater directive. It repeats the host element for each element in a list.
		
		. <li> is the host element
		. heroes holds the mock heroes list from the HeroesComponent class, the mock heroes list.
		. hero holds the current hero object for each iteration through the list.
		
	
	What happened?	
	
		HeroesComponent.html:3 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
	
	When the app starts, the selectedHero is undefined by design.
	Binding expressions in the template that refer to properties of selectedHero—expressions like {{selectedHero.name}}—must fail
	because there is no selected hero.
	
	
	The fix - hide empty details with *ngIf
	
	The component should only display the selected hero details if the selectedHero exists.
	Wrap the hero detail HTML in a <div>. Add Angular's *ngIf directive to the <div> and set it to selectedHero.
	
	
	- Class binding
	
	The Angular class binding makes it easy to add and remove a CSS class conditionally. Just add [class.some-css-class]="some-condition"
	to the element you want to style.

	Add the following [class.selected] binding to the <li> in the HeroesComponent template:

	heroes.component.html (toggle the 'selected' CSS class)

		[class.selected]="hero === selectedHero"
		
		
	- @Input() decorator
		
	The hero property must be an Input property, annotated with the @Input() decorator, because the external HeroesComponent will bind to it like this.

		<app-hero-detail [hero]="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail>	
		
		. [hero]="selectedHero" is an Angular property binding.
		
	- Refactoring
	
	Refactoring the original HeroesComponent into two components yields benefits, both now and in the future:

	You simplified the HeroesComponent by reducing its responsibilities.

	You can evolve the HeroDetailComponent into a rich hero editor without touching the parent HeroesComponent.

	You can evolve the HeroesComponent without touching the hero detail view.

	You can re-use the HeroDetailComponent in the template of some future component.
	
	
	Why services ? 
	
	Components shouldn't fetch or save data directly and they certainly shouldn't knowingly present fake data. 
	They should focus on presenting data and delegate data access to a service.

	In this tutorial, you'll create a HeroService that all application classes can use to get heroes. 
	Instead of creating that service with new, you'll rely on Angular dependency injection to inject it into the HeroesComponent constructor.

	Services are a great way to share information among classes that don't know each other. You'll create a 
	MessageService and inject it in two places:

		in HeroService which uses the service to send a message
		in MessagesComponent which displays that message
			
	
	Creating a service (https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt4#create-the-heroservice)
	
	
	Observable data
	
	The HeroService.getHeroes() method has a synchronous signature, which implies that the HeroService can 
	fetch heroes synchronously. The HeroesComponent consumes the getHeroes() result as if heroes could be fetched synchronously.

	src/app/heroes/heroes.component.ts
	
		this.heroes = this.heroService.getHeroes();
		
	This will not work in a real app. You're getting away with it now because the service currently returns mock heroes. 
	But soon the app will fetch heroes from a remote server, which is an inherently asynchronous operation.

	The HeroService must wait for the server to respond, getHeroes() cannot return immediately with hero data, and the 
	browser will not block while the service waits.

	HeroService.getHeroes() must have an asynchronous signature of some kind.

	In this tutorial, HeroService.getHeroes() will return an Observable because it will eventually use the 
	Angular HttpClient.get method to fetch the heroes and HttpClient.get() returns an Observable.

	Observable HeroService
	Observable is one of the key classes in the RxJS library.

	In a later tutorial on HTTP, you'll learn that Angular's HttpClient methods return RxJS Observables. In this tutorial, 
	you'll simulate getting data from the server with the RxJS of() function.

	Open the HeroService file and import the Observable and of symbols from RxJS.
	
	
	Provide the HeroService
	
	You must make the HeroService available to the dependency injection system before Angular can inject it into the HeroesComponent 
	by registering a provider. A provider is something that can create or deliver a service; in this case, it instantiates the HeroService 
	class to provide the service
	
	
	Routes
	
	The next part of the file is where you configure your routes. Routes tell the Router which view to display when a user clicks
	a link or pastes a URL into the browser address bar.

	Since AppRoutingModule already imports HeroesComponent, you can use it in the routes array:

		src/app/app-routing.module.ts

			const routes: Routes = [
			  { path: 'heroes', component: HeroesComponent }
			];
	
			
			A typical Angular Route has two properties:

				. path: a string that matches the URL in the browser address bar.
				. component: the component that the router should create when navigating to this route
				
			This tells the router to match that URL to path: 'heroes' and display the HeroesComponent when the URL is something like localhost:4200/heroes.

	. by default all the attributes of a class are only accesibles by the component not from outside
	
		export class ServerElementComponent {
			element: {type: string, name: string, content: string};
